##Contest Brief:

Your job: create a very simple "Links" page in Bootstrap!

Rules:

1. I am looking for very simple design with *minimum* html/css/js code used
2. must be based on Bootstrap 3.3.6 (responsive)
3. no color preferences, just keep it simple!

Requirements:

The page has two parts:
- "Featured Websites"
- "Links"

Featured websites lists 3 websites. Each website shows:
- website screenshot (thumbnail)
- link to website
- a short description

Below "Featured Websites" there is a part called "Links". This part has:
- pagination (buttons/links to show pages)
- 10 x link to a website with a short description
- a button saying "Submit your link"

Link to any website you want, I will change it later as needed.

For example, a more modern version of a simple page like this, but without any forms and without pagerank:
phpjun(DELETE)kyard(DELETE).com/link(DELETE)man/links(DELETE).php

That's it!!

Good luck and remember: LESS IS MORE!
